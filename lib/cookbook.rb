# putting it into the recipes array

#Â after this, add the add_recipe method and the all_recipe method

# when adding a recipe the to the cookbook we need to update the csv

# cookbook = Cookbook.new("lib/recipes.csv")
# p cookbook

# lasagna = Recipe.new("lasagna", "delicious")
# cookbook.create(lasagna)

# an instance of cookbook, with 2 instance variables (@csv, @recipes)
# @recipes will store 2 instances of recipe made from gthe csv
